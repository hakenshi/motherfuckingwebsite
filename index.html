    <h1>This is a motherfucking website</h1>
    <p>And it’s fucking beautiful.</p>

    <h2>Frameworks aren’t the solution — they’re the disease.</h2>
    <p>A website doesn’t any bloated JS frameworks to work.</p>

    <h2>This shit is lightweight as hell.</h2>
    <p>Shipping 500MB of JavaScript for a todo app? You’ve lost your damn mind.</p>
    <p>The web's a mess because companies want you to think a fucking to-do app needs 50 layers of auth with Next.js,
        Clerk, Tailwind, and a
        mountain of dependencies.</p>

    <h2>This shit is responsive.</h2>
    <p>You don’t need `md:` or `lg:` or utility class soup. This site runs on a 10-year-old Galaxy Pocket — even a damn
        calculator.</p>

    <p>Two media queries. Five CSS properties. That’s all it takes.</p>
    <p style="font-family: serif;">Also, fuck fonts with serif. Who's the moron who thought that any website is fucking
        readable with a thing like this?</p>
    <h2>Stop reiventing buttons</h2>
    <p>You don't need 20 npm packages to make a button</p>

    <p>Look at this. <button> It's a button</button></p>
    <p>It's a simple button and it is just fucking gorgeous.</p>

    <h2>No compilers</h2>

    <p>HTML is already a declarative language. Why the fuck do you need a compiler?</p>
    <p>So you can SSR your bloated react application beacuse there's 500 megs of JavaScript just so you can render a
        fucking counter component on the virtual DOM?</p>
    <p>Oh poor thing. Maybe you should just write plain HTML next time.</p>
    
    <h2>Zero Buildsteps, Zero bullshit.</h2>
    <p>No Vite, No Webpack, No Babel. You hit save, it reloads, and it works. Like it was fucking meant to be.</p>

    <h2>This thing just fucking works.</h2>
    <p>No JS. No dependencies. Just clean HTML and CSS that does what it’s supposed to.</p>

    <h2>Yes, you nitwit, this is a satire.</h2>
    <p>This is a modern take on <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/" target="_blank">motherfuckingwebsite</a>,
        calling out today’s bloated dev culture.</p>
    <p>Frameworks are tools — not gods. The moment you forget that, the tool starts using you.</p>
    <p>Not everything needs to be a fullstack web application with some crappy ORM sticked way up the website's ass. You fuck.</p>
